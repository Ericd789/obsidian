As shown in the figure below, a uniform electric field with magnitude 1000 N/C points in the upward direction on the page. In the presence of this field, what is the change in potential _V_ in going from point A (x,y) = (1,1) m to point B (x,y) = (4,5) m, along the path depicted below?

1. G:
	1. uniform electric field with magnitude 1000 N/C points in the upward
	2. From (1,1)m to (4,5)m
	3. $\Delta_x  = 3 \quad \Delta_y = 4$
2. U: $\Delta V$ 
3. E: $V = Ed = E (\Delta_y + \Delta_x)$ (because of uniform field)
4. S: $V = -[1000j \cdot (3i + 4j)] = -[1000j \cdot 3i + 1000j \cdot 4j] = -4000j$  
5. S: $V = -4000j$

Three charges lie on the _x_-axis, each a distance _a_ apart. The charges are numbered from 1 to 3 moving from left to right. A representation of the electric potential _V_ of these three charges is shown below. Which one of the following statements is completely true?
1.  The E field is never zero between charges 1 and 2 but it is zero at some point between charges 2 and 3 
2. The E field is never zero between charges 1 and 2 and it is never zero between charges 2 and 3
3. The E field is zero at some point between charges 1 and 2 but it is never zero between charges 2 and 3
4. None of the other 
5. The E field is zero at some point between charges 1 and 2 and also at some point between charges 2 and 3

**ANS:** The E field **is zero** at some point between charges 1 and 2 but it **is never zero** between charges 2 and 3

A parallel plate capacitor is charged using a battery and the battery is then removed. The plates of the capacitor are now brought closer together. Which of the following statements is **False**?
1. The potential difference between the plates of the capacitor decreases.
2. The capacitance of the capacitor increases.
3. The charge on the capacitor remains the same.
4. The energy stored in the capacitor increases.
5. The electric field inside the capacitor remains the same.

**ANS:** 4 (Energy stored in the capacitor decreases) + (The capacitance is increased) + (The potential difference decreases because $\Delta V = Q/C$) 
- When a capacitor is connected to the power supply the potential difference can't change
- Moving the plates further apart decreases the capacitance and reduces the charge stored by the capacitor

A 60-watt light bulb carries a current of 0.5A. The total charge passing through it in one hour is:
1. 1800 C
2. 3000 C
3. 120 C
4. 3600 C
5. 2400 C

4. S: $Q = 0.5A \cdot 3600s$
5. S: $Q = 1800 C$

Hint: Superconductor are cold and conduct electricity better.

1. THICK, SHORT, COOL

The current is zero in a conductor when potential difference is applied because: 
1. at any instant, electrons are moving randomly, possibly with very large velocities, in a way that their average velocity is zero.
2. the electrons are not moving
3. equal numbers of electrons and protons are moving together.
4. the electrons are too strongly bound to the atoms.
5. the electrons are not moving fast enough.

Calculate $I$
![[Pasted image 20220331150341.png |300]]
OHMS Law: $V = IR$
$I = I_1 + I_2 + I_3$
$I_1 = \frac{V}{R_1} = \frac{30V}{5\Omega} = 6A$ 
$I_2 = \frac{V}{R_2} = \frac{30V}{6 \Omega} = 5A$
$I_3 = \frac{V}{R_3} = \frac{30V}{10 \Omega} = 3A$
$I = I_1 + I_2 + I_3 = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14$ amps


------
Calculate $I_1$
![[Pasted image 20220331150832.png |400]]
$I = 2I_1 + I_2$
- This is because $I_1$ has  $5 \Omega$ of resistance while $I_2$ has $10 \Omega$ of resistance

$6A = 2I_1 + I_2 = 2(2) + 2$ 
$I_1  = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \cdot I_T= 4$

In the circuit below, when the switch is **CLOSED**, the current through the 12 Ω resistor is 0.5 A. What is the current through the 12 Ω resistor when the switch is **OPEN?**
![[Pasted image 20220331133612.png |200]]

OHMS Law: $V = IR$
$I = I_1 + I_2$ 
$R_T = 15 \Omega$  
$V = IR_T = (0.5A)(15\Omega) = 7.5V$
