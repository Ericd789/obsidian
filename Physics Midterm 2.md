A parallel plate capacitor is charged using a battery and the battery is then removed. The plates of the capacitor are now brought closer together. Which of the following statements is **False**?
1. The potential difference between the plates of the capacitor decreases.
2. The capacitance of the capacitor increases.
3. The charge on the capacitor remains the same.
4. The energy stored in the capacitor increases.
5. The electric field inside the capacitor remains the same.

- When a capacitor is connected to the power supply the potential difference can't change
- Moving the plates further apart decreases the capacitance and reduces the charge stored by the capacitor

Calculate $I$
![[Pasted image 20220331150341.png |300]]
OHMS Law: $V = IR$
$I = I_1 + I_2 + I_3$
$I_1 = \frac{V}{R_1} = \frac{30V}{5\Omega} = 6A$ 
$I_2 = \frac{V}{R_2} = \frac{30V}{6 \Omega} = 5A$
$I_3 = \frac{V}{R_3} = \frac{30V}{10 \Omega} = 3A$
$I = I_1 + I_2 + I_3 = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14$ amps

Calculate $I_1$
![[Pasted image 20220331150832.png |400]]
$I = 2I_1 + I_2$
- This is because $I_1$ has  $5 \Omega$ of resistance while $I_2$ has $10 \Omega$ of resistance

$6A = 2I_1 + I_2 = 2(2) + 2$ 
$I_1  = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \cdot I_T= 4$

In the circuit below, when the switch is **CLOSED**, the current through the 12 Ω resistor is 0.5 A. What is the current through the 12 Ω resistor when the switch is **OPEN?**
![[Pasted image 20220331133612.png |200]]

OHMS Law: $V = IR$
**With switch closed**
$I_3 = I_1 + I_2$ 
$I_1 = 0.5A$
$I_2 = \frac{R_1I}{R_2} = \frac{(12\Omega)(0.5A)}{4\Omega}= 1.5A$ 
$I_3 = I_1 + I_2 = 0.5A + 1.5A = 2.0A$
$E = (12\Omega)(0.5A) + (3\Omega)(2.0A) = 12V$

**With switch open**
$R_T = 12 \Omega + 3 \Omega = 15 \Omega$
$I = \frac{E}{R_T} = \frac{12V}{15\Omega} = 0.8A$
ANS: 0.8A

What is the power dissipated in the 1 Ω resistor?
![[Pasted image 20220331133639.png |300]]
$I_1 = I_2 + I_3$
$E_1 = I_1R_1 + I_3R_3 = 2I_1 + I_3$ 
$E_2 = I_2R_2 + I_3R_3 = 2I_2 + I_3$
$E_1 = E_2 = 10V$
$E_1 = 2(I_2 + I_3) + I_3 = 2I_2 + 3I_3$
$E_2 = 2(I_2 - I_3) + I_3 = 2I_2 - I_3$
$E_1 = E_2 = ... = 2I_2 + 3I_3 = 2I_2 - I_3$
$0 = 4I_3$
$I_3 = 0$
$2I_2 + 0 = 10V; I_2 = 5V$
$2I_1 + 0 = 10V; I_1 = 5V$
