## 29 Magnetism
##### What is magnetism?
Magnetism is an interaction between moving charges
- Magnetic froces, similar to electric forces, are due to the cation of magnetic fields
- A magnetic field $\overrightarrow{B}$ is created by a moving charge
- Magnetic interactions are understood in terms of magnetic poles, **North and South**
- Magnetic poles never occur in isolation. All magnets are dipoles, with two poles
- Practical magnetic fields are created by currents-collections of moving charges
- Magnetic matreials such as iron, occur because electrons have an inherent magnetic dipole called _electron spin_

##### What fields are especially important?
There are 3 important magnetic field models

##### How do charges respond to magnetic fields?
A charged particle moving in a magnetic field experiences a force perpendicular to both $\overrightarrow{B}$ and $\overrightarrow{v}$. The perpendicular force causes charged particles to move in circular orbits in a uniform magnetic field. This [[Definitions#Cyclontron Motion |cyclontron motion]] has many important applications.

##### How do currents respond to magnetic fields?
Currents are moving charged particles, so:
- There's a force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic filed
- Two parallel current-carrying wires attract or repel each other
- There's a torque on a current loop in a magnetic filed. This is how motors work.

##### Why is magnetism important
Magnetism is much more important than a way to hold a shopping list on the refridgerator door. Motors and generators are based on magnetic forces. Many forms of data storage , from hard disks to the stripe on your credit card, are magnetic. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential to modern medicine. Magnetic levitation trains are being built around the world. And the earth's magnetic field keeps solar winds from streilizing the earth's surface. There would be no life and no modern technology without magnetism.


## 29.1 Magnetism
### Discovering Magnetism
Experiment 1:
If a bar magnet is taped to a cork it will always allign itself with the earth's north and south poles

### Traits of magnetism
1.  First, magnetism is not the same as electricity. Magnetic poles and electric charges share some similar behavior, but they are not the same.
2.  Magnetism is a long-range force. Paper clips leap upward to a magnet.
3. Magnets have two poles, north and south known as **magnetic dipoles**. The forces from north and south are attractive towards each other, but repellant toward the same force.
	1. Opposite polse attract
4. **Magnetic Materials** are materials that are attracted to magnets. The most common magnetic material is **Iron**

**The earth is also known as one big magnet**

## 29.2 Discovery of the Magnetic Field
##### The connection between magnetism and electricity
Magnetism is caused by an electric current. Note, when compasses surround a current carrying wire they allign tangent to the magnetic field

##### Definiting the Magnetic Field
1. A magnetic field is created at all points in space surrounding a current-carrying wire
2. The magnetic field at each point is a vector, with both direction and magnitude
3. Our created magnetic field exerts forces on earth's magnetic poles. The force on the north pole is parallel to $\vec{B}$. The force on the south pole is opposite to $\vec{B}$
