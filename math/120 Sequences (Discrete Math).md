## Sequences
A sequence is an enumerated collection of objects in a particular order that follows some rule or formula. 
Denoted typically as lowercase letters of the form $(a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n)$

### Kinds of formulas
1. Closed formula (function)
2. Recursive formula

##### Closed Formula
A sequence is a formula where each term $a_k$ is defined based on its position in the list

Ex. $a_n = n^2$ 

##### Recursive Formula
A sequence $a_n$ is a formula where each term $a_k$ is defined based on one or more previous sequences

Ex. Fibonacci Numbers

### Summation and Product Notations
A summation sequence is the addition of a sequence and a product sequence of numbers is the multiplication of a sequence.

**Summation Notation**
$$\sum ^b_{k=n}x_n + n_{n+1} + ... + x_b$$
