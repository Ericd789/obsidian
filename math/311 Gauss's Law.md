##### What is Gauss's Law
A general statement about the nature of electric fields. It is more fundamental than coulomb's law and the first of what we later call Maxwell's equations, the governing equations of electricity and magnetism

#### What is electric flux
The amount of electric field passing through a surface is called the electric flux. Electric flux is analagous to the amount of air or water flowing through a loop. Electric flux can be calculated for both open and closed surfaces

#### How is Gauss's law used
To use Gauss's Law, you calculate the electric flux through a **Gaussian surface** surrounding the charge

#### What good is symmetry
For charge distributions with a high degree of symmetry, the symmetry of the electric field must match the symmetry of the charge distribution. Important symmetries are **planar symmetry**, **cylindrical symmetry** and **spherical symmetry**.

#### What can we learn about conductors
Gauss's law can be used to establish several properties of conductors in electrostatic equilibrium, per say
- Any excess charge is all on the surface
- The interior electric field is zero
- The external field is perpendicular to the surface


### 24.1 Symmetry
1. The field points away from positive charges, towards negative charges 
2. An electric field exerts a force on a charged particle

##### Symmetric charge distribution
A charge is symmetric if the object can be transformed in the following ways and keep the same charge pattern
1. Translate (slide)
2. Rotate
3. Reflect (invert)

 **Note:** The symmetry of the electric field must match the symmetry of the charge distribution

 ##### Gaussian Surface
 **Definition:** A closed surface in 3-D space through which the flux of a vector field is calculated, referring to the gravitational field, electrical field or magnetic field
