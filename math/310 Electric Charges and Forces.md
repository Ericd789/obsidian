# 22 Electric Charges and Forces
1. What is an electric charge?
	1. Electric properties depend on a charge. 
	2. There are two charges, positive and negative
	3. Electrons = (-)
	4. Protons = (+)

## 22.1 The Charge Model
![[Pasted image 20220125164910.png]]
1. In experiment 1, no forces were observed and the objects had a neutral charge
2. In experiment 2 and 3, by rubbing the rods we charged them, or transfered the number of electrons they had. These two experiments had different effects due to the type of objects present in them.
3. In experiment 4, this experiment shows how important distance is to charged objects

Applying a charge to an objects sometimes leads to that object being either a positive or negative charge

#### How can we tell if an object is charged or neutral?
Test 1: Charged objects seem to almost always pick up small pieces of paper. If it fails this test, the object is neutral

#### How to charge an object?
The more vigirous the rubbing, the increase the charge will be


#### Why are some charged objects attracted to one another and others repelling?
Objects with opposite charges attract each other while objects with the same charge repel one another

#### What is the difference between a glass charge and a plastic charge?
A glass charge is always positive while a plastic charge is always negative. This can occur if you rub a glass rod with a cloth, the charge produced on the glass rod is called positive, whereas when a plastic rod is rubbed with a cloth produces a negative charge.

#### How can one charge be more powerful than another?
By having a larger imbalance in charge, you will get a more powerful charge. Also, the distance the object is away from the target will dictate the strength of the effect.

1. You can transfer charge to a metal ball by touching it to another charged object.
2. Rubbing your fingers along a charged object removes the charge from it.
3. Plastic doesn't allow for the transfer of the plastic charge while the metal rods succeeds in charging the far metal ball.





### Definitions
##### Charging
The transfer of electrons from one object to another

##### Discharging
Removing an objects charge to return it to a neutral state

##### Conductors
Materials in which charge can easily move between
Ex. metal, salt water

##### Insulators
Materials in which charges remain immobile
Ex. glass, plastic, rubber


## 22.2 Charge
Benjamin Franklin pioneered the terms positive and negative charge, along with plastic being negative and glass being positive.

Atoms are at the heart of charges. They are an object with a dense nucleus, surrounded by an electron cloud that has a diameter $10^4$ times larger than that of the nucleus.

- Protons and Electrons each have the same charge.
- Mass is an inherent property of both protons and electrons
- Objects cannot transfer charge simply by being close to one another, they must have contact

Formula for charge
$q = N_p e - N_e e = (N_p - N_e )e$
net charge: $q=0$
positive charge: $q>0$
negative charge: $q<0$

Conductors quickly disperse charges among themselves

Because the human body is mostly made of salt water, it is an incredibly good conductor. This means we typically discharge objects

#### Definitions:
##### Electrons
Objects with both mass and a negative charge.

##### Electron cloud
The electron cloud is a field that surrounds an atom's nucleus, creating a negatively charged field.

##### Nucleus
The dense core of an atom with a positive charge.

##### Charge Quantization
The fact that charges only differ in whole integers and not continuous values. 

##### Ionization
The process of removing an electron from an electron cloud

##### Law of conservation of charge
The idea that a charge cannot be destroyed, only transferred to something else through the movement of electrons

##### Valence Electrons
In metals, these are weakly bound electrons that can move easily


##### Current
The motion of charges between materials is called current

##### Charge Carriers
The charges that move physically 

##### Charge Polarization
The movement of the electron cloud to specify which side has a posititve charge and which has a negative

##### Charging by Induction
When a charges disperses evenly among an object removing the charged end

##### Point Charges
The force between particles as denoted through Columb's Law in formula $F_{1 on 2}=F_{2 on 1}=\frac{K|q_1||q_2|}{r^2}$


### 22.4 Columb's Law

Columb's Law Formula:
$$F_{1 on 2}=F_{2 on 1}=\frac{K|q_1||q_2|}{r^2}$$
$K=$ electrostatic contstant
