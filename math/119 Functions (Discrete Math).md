## Functions
An equation that takes an input and provides an output

##### One-to-one
AKA: Injective

A function is one-to-one if...
$$\text{for all x,y } \in A \text{ if } f(x)=f(y), \text{then } x=y$$
In other words, by taking contrapositive of the implication in the function, function f is one-to-one
$$\text{if } x \ne y, f(x)\ne f(y)$$

> _Let A_ = {_P_1, _P_2, _P_3} _and B_ = {_File1, File2, File3, File4_}. _Let f_ : _A_ → _B be a function defined as f_ = { (_P_1,_File_ 2), (_P_2,_File_ 3), (_P_3,_File_ 1)}.
> Is function f one-to-one correspondence.
>
> The function is one-to-one correspondence because for each value of the domain, fnuction f maps to different values in codomain

##### Onto
The functions $f$ is onto (or surjection) B if
$$\text{for every }y \in B \text{ there is an } x \in A \text{ such that } f(x)=y$$
Symbolically,
$$\forall y \in B\exists x \in A,f(x)=y$$

Which function is an onto function?
> _Let_ _A_ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} _and_ _B_ = {7, 8, 9, 10}
> _f_ = { _(1,7), (2,7), (3,8), (4,9), (5,9), (6,10)_ }
> _g_ ={ _(1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,9), (5,9), (6,10)_ }
> 
> ANS: $f$ is an onto function but g is not because 8 is not mapped by any element from domain A.

##### Bijective
Function f is a bijection (or bijective) when it is both one-to-one (injecitve) and onto (surjective) function

> _Let A_ = {1, 2, 3} _and_ _B_ = {_chocolate, icecream, cake_}. _Let_ f:A→B _where f =_ { _(1,_ _cake)_, _(2, chocolate)_, _(3, ice cream)_,} _determine whether function f is a bijective function._
> 
> ANS: We can rewrite the function as following:
> f(1)=cake
> f(2)=chocolate
> f(3)= ice cream

##### Onto 
For every element in the domain, there is an element in the codomain that it maps to
