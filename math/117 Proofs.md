# Chapter 3: Proofs
##### Proof
**Definition:** A statement that can be verified as true for any condition

##### Lemma
**Definition:** A theorem whose purpose is to help prove another theorem

##### Corollary
**Definition:** An immediate consequence of a theorem or proposition


##### Odd theorem
An integer is odd if $n=2 \cdot a + 1$ for some integer $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ 
In logic, 
$$n \text{ is odd} \leftrightarrow \exists a \in \mathbb{Z}, (n=2 \cdot a + 1)$$
##### Even Odd theorem
An integer is even if $n=2 \cdot a$ for some integer $a \in \mathbb{Z}$ 
In logic, 
$$n \text{ is even} \leftrightarrow \exists a \in \mathbb{Z}, (n=2 \cdot a)$$
##### Parity
Two integers have the same parity if they are both either even or both odd


## 3.3 Indirect Proofs
##### Proof by Contraposative:
Proof where a conditional statement is equivalent to its contrapositive

##### Proof by Contradiction 
Proof where either a statement is true or it is false but not both
