# Neural Networks (nn)
The science of deep learning is one stemmed from multi-layered (deep) neural networks. 

## History
The deep learning revolution was due to 2 reasons
1. Increased compute from GPUs
2. Large amount of data available

These two things have enabled the deep learning revolution that began in the 20th century, as neural networks have been around since the 1950s. Neural networks were previously very simple with few layers. Single layered networks were known as a single layer perceptron. The increased compute enabled us to create more layers in the network.
