## 1.1 Digital Hardware
##### Digital Hardware
Definition: Products created to build a computer.

##### Logic Circuits
Definition: A circuit used to perform logical operations on input signals

Computer Hardware History:
- Until the 1960s, logic circuits were comprised of bulky compontents like transistors and resistors until the invention of the integrated circuit.
- The invention of the integrated circuit made it possible to compress multiple transistors onto one device. 
- Integrated Circuits (IC) are manufactured on a silicon wafer, which is cut into individual chips.

- Advancements in integrated circuits led to the creation of the microprocessor, leading to the next creation of affordable home computers
- About 30 years ago, Gordon Moore (chairman of Intel Corp) noticed 2x transistors were present on chips every 2 years, leading to the coining of the phenomenon Moore's Law. 
##### Moore's Law
Defintion: The phenomenon that the number of transistors on a chip will double every 2 years
