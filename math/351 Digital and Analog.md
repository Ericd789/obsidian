#### Digital Computer: A device utilizing the binary system to compute, computing through 0's and 1's. This is the type all computers use today due to speed and integrity it provides.
**Binary System:** A number system ranging with numbers from 0-1 (radix 2)
**Decimal to Binary:** 
11011010 -> (128)(64)(32)(16)(8)(2)(1) -> 218

**Switches:** A compontent that can turn on and off the power supply recieved by the computer, making the binary system very lucrative (0V - 5V)



##### Difference Between Analog Computers and Digital Computers
| Analog Computer | Digital Computer | 
| --------------- | ---------------- |
Uses continuous values | Discrete values (0, 1)| 
Slower	| Faster
Can store less data | More data
Less reliable | More reliable
Less accurate | More accurate
