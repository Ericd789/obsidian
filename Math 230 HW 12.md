##### Question 2

5. Integral 2:
	1. $r_2(t) = (t, 3 - t^2)$
	2. $r_2'(t) = (1, -2t)$ 
	3. $F_2(r_2(t)) = \langle (t)^4 + 2(t)(3-t^2)^2, 2 - (3-t^2)e^{(3-t^2)} \rangle = \langle t^4 + 18t-6t^2+t^4, 2 - 3e^{3-t^2} + t^2 e^{(3-t^2)} \rangle$ 
	4. $F_2(r_2(t)) \cdot r_2'(t) = \langle t^4 + 18t-6t^2+t^4, 2 - 3e^{3-t^2} + t^2 e^{(3-t^2)} \rangle \cdot (1, -2t)$
