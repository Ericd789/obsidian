##### Kirchoff's Law
A quantification of how current flows through a circuit and how voltage varies around a loop in a circuit.


##### Potential Difference
The difference of electric potential between two points


##### Calculate Circuits in Series
Calculate the Amps traversing the circuit

1. Calculate $R_T$ or Total Resistance
	1. $R_T = 6 \Omega + 4 \Omega = 10 \Omega$  
2. Using Ohm's Law, calculate Amps
	1. $E = IR_T$
	2. $I = \frac{E}{R_T} = \frac{30V}{10\Omega} = 3A$ 
3. Now with the Amps calculated, we can solve for the volts reaching each resistor
	1. $V_1 = IR_1 = (3A)(6 \Omega) = 18V$
	2. $V_2 = IR_2 = (3A)(4 \Omega) = 12V$



##### Kirchoff's Current Law  / Junction Rule / (1st Law)
The current flowing into a node (or junction) must be equal to the current flowing out of it. This is known as **charge conservation**
$$I_3 = I_1 + I_2$$

$$I_1 + I_2 + I_3 = 0$$

$$I + 5A = 3A + 4A + 2A \quad I = 9A - 5A = 4A = 4A$$

##### Kirchoff's Voltage Law  / Loop Rule /(2nd Law)
The sum of all the electric potential differences around a loop is zero. This means the energy supplied by the battery is used up by all the other compontents in the loop since energy can't enter or leave the circuit.
$$\sum \Delta V = 0$$

> 1. $\sum \Delta V = 0$
> 2. $\epsilon - V_1 - V_2 = 0$
> 3. $V_1 = \epsilon - V_2$ 




##### Junction
Intersection of three or more pathways in a circuit

##### Branch
A path connecting two junctions

##### Ohm's Law
The current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points
$$E = IR$$
$$E = \text{Volts (V) \quad I = Current (Amps: A) \quad R = Resistance (Ohms: }\Omega)$$
##### Joule's Law
$$P = IE$$
$$P = \text{Power:  (Watts: W) \quad I = Current (Amps: A) \quad E = Volts (V) }$$


##### Current
The rate at which electrons flow past a point in a complete electrical circuit
