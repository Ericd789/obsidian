## 7.1 Basic Counting Rules 

##### Product Rule
A way of representing large sets of numbers through variable indexing. 
$$L_1L_2L_3D_1D_2D_3 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot2 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 2^3 \cdot 3^3 = 216$$

> How many possible passwords can we create if the first entry is selected from {a,e,i} and the second entry is from {2,8} and the thirde entry is from {u,v}?
> 1. Use the product rule to solve number of possible combinations
> 	1. $$3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 12$$
> ----
> Suppose the following menu: 
> **Appetizers:** Fried Wontons, Garlic Cheese Toast, Pineapple Salsa

> $$\frac{\text{num of possible elements}}{\text{to divide to get 4 elements}} = \frac{9!}{5!} = 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 = 3024$$

##### Sum Rule
The sum rule is the size of union of sets where sets are  [[119 Sets#Disjoint Sets|disjoint sets]].
$$|T| = |t_1 \cup t_2 \cup ... \cup t_x| = |t_1 | + |t_2| + ... + |t_x|$$

> Suppose you went to a restaurant for lunch. There are 8 choices for burger, 5 choices for rice and 7 choices for pizza. How many options do you have?
> $$8 + 5 + 7 = 20$$
> ---
> Suppose there are seven books of computer science (CS), five books of arts, and eleven books of business. How many ways can we select two books from different subjects?
> 
> **ANS:** (CS Books x Arts Books) + (CS Books x Business Books) + (Arts Books x Business Books) 
> $$(7 \cdot 5) + (7 \cdot 11) + (5 \cdot 11) = 167$$
> ---
> Suppose we roll a perfect six-sided dice five times and record the result as an ordered list of length five. How many possible outcomes contain exactly one 3?
>
> **ANS:** Because it is possible to roll 3 on each interval (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th) of the 5 throw of dice, your answer would be $5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 = 5^5$ 

##### Inclusion Exclusion Rule
If a task T can be done either by $T_1$ or by task $T_2$, where $T_1$ and $T_2$ are not [[119 Sets#Disjoint Sets|disjoint sets]], then task $T$ can be done in $|T_1| + |T_2| - T_1 \cap T_2|$ ways.

> **Q:** How many three-digit numbers use distinct digits from {1, ... , 7}?

> 
> **Q:** How many of those are odd?
> **ANS:** Set of odd numbers = {1, 3, 5, 7}.
> We also know that the numbers must be distinct, and since 7 is odd, we must start our count at 6 and descend to 5 giving us $4 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 = 120$ 
> 
> **Q:** How many of those are even?
> **ANS:** Using [[122 Counting and Probability#Inclusion Exclusion Rule|Inclusion Exclusion Rule]], we can just subtract our sets from one another to get $210 - 120 = 90$ 
> ----
> How many numbers from the set of integers between 1 and 100, inclusive, are divisible by 3 or 5 or 7?

> 3. C = Set / 7 = $\lfloor \frac{100}{7} \rfloor = 14$  
> Now you must find the total number of possible combinations while subtracting the overlapping elements so you have a **distinct** set

### 7.2 Permutations and Combinations
Two ways of finding different ways to arrange a number of distinct elements

##### Difference between Permutation and Combination
- Permutation is for when order **does** matter
- Combination is for when order **doesn't** matter


#### Permutations
A permutation is an ordered [[122 Counting and Probability#Combinations|combination]], typically leading to more possible combinations.
1. Permutations with repititon $(n^r)$  
2. Permutations without repitition $(n!)$ 

An arrangement of a set of (distinct) elements is an ordering of the elements, where order matters.

##### Permutations With Repition
When an element is selected it doesn't affect the other sets left to choose for

**For a unique item available per pick**
$$n = \text{num of items} \quad r = \text{num of choices} \quad P(n) = n^r$$

> On a lock 3 digit combination lock with 0 through 10 on each digit, how many possible combinations are there for the lock?
> $$10^3 = 1000 \text{ permutations}$$

**Where unique items is less than picks**
$$C(n + r - 1, r)$$
- $n$ = number of items to choose from
- $r$ is the number of choices

##### Permutations Without Repition
Where selecting from a set affects the rest of the selections, denoted by $P(n)$
$$P(n) = n!$$
> Suppose there is a set with three elements {a,b,c}. What is the possible permutations?
> **ANS:** $3! = 6$ 
> ----
> We have 16 pool balls. How many different orders can we draw the balls in?
> **ANS:** $16! = 20,922,789,888,000$ 

##### Permutation Arrangements / r-permutations
A [[122 Counting and Probability#Permutations Without Repition|permutation without repition]] where you don't select all the options available
$$P(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!} \quad r \le n \quad n = \text{items available} \quad r = \text{items selected}$$

###### Examples :: Permutation Arrangements:
> In how many ways can we select a first-prize winner, a second-prize winner, a third-prize winner, and a fourth-prize winner from a group of 50 different people?
> $$P(50, 4) = \frac{50}{(50-4)!} = \frac{50!}{46!} = 50 \cdot 49 \cdot 48 \cdot 47 = 5527200$$
> ----
> How many three-digit numbers are there that do not contain repeated digits and start with a non-zero digit?
> 
> **ANS:** There are two ways we can do this. We can either (1) Compute the answer directly by finding the permutation of the set with 9 as the first number instead of 10 (since we don't use number 0 -> ($10-1 = 9$). We can also find the total number of permutations and subtract the permutation of set 0 to get the same answer.
> $$9 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = (10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8) - (1 \cdot 9 \cdot 8) = 648$$
> ----
> How many strings of four letters from the English alphabet contain exactly one vowel?
> 1. Set up sets
> 	1. $$v = \{a, e, i, o, u\}\quad |v| = 5 \quad c = \{b, c, d, ..., z\} \quad |c| = 21$$
> 2. Solve permutation arrangement for $P(4,1) = 4$ positions for the vowel
> 3. Solve the permutation for number of possible combinations using 1 vowel and 3 consonants
> 	1. $$P(4,1) \cdot v \cdot c \cdot c \cdot c = 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 21 \cdot 21 \cdot 21 = 185220$$
> 

#### Circular Permutation
The total number of ways in which n distinct objects can be arranged around a fixed circle. We can either direction around the set.
![[Pasted image 20220419083123.png]]

##### Unique Circular Permutation
If clockwise and anticlockwise orders are different
$$P_c(n) = (n-1)!$$
##### Similar Circular Permutation
If clockwise and anticlockwise orders are the same
$$P_c(n) = \frac{(n-1)!}{2!}$$

##### Permutation with Repeated Elements
If elements in a set are repeated,we then we treate the permutation differently.
- For example "apple" has two P's
$$P(e) = \frac{P(n,r)}{e_1! \cdot e_2! \cdot ... e_k!} \quad e = \text{repeated items}$$
> How many different 5-digit numbers can be formed using the following digits 1, 3, 5, 5, 7, 9, 9,11? Assume the repeated digits are all used.
> 1. Since there are 2 5's and 2 9's, using the formula[[122 Counting and Probability#Permutations With Repition|permutation with repeated elements]]
> $$P(e) = \frac{P(8,5)}{2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{\frac{8!}{(8-5)!}}{2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{6720}{16} = 1680$$

#### Combinations
Selecting items from a set where order **doesn't** matter.

##### Combinatons without Repetition
Combination where each element is a distinct set. For example, you can win the lottery with selecting all the numbers no matter the order you selected them.
$$C(n,r) = nCr = \begin{pmatrix} n \\ r \end{pmatrix} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \quad n = \text{items available} \quad r = \text{items chosen}$$
> We have 16 pool balls and we will only draw 3. How many different combinations of the balls can we make where order doesn't matter?
> 1. Using [[122 Counting and Probability#Combinatons without Repetition|combinations without repetition]] 
> $$C(16, 3) = _{16}C_3 = \frac{16!}{3!(16-3)!} = 560$$
> ---
> How many five-person committees can be formed from 250 students?
> 1. Since the order of students doesn't matter, we can use the [[122 Counting and Probability#Combinatons without Repetition|combinations without repetition]] formula
> $$C(250, 5) = \frac{250!}{5!(250-5)!} = 7,817,031,300$$
> ----
> There are 10 different kinds of chocolates. In how many ways can we pick five chocolates from the first box, three chocolates from the second box, and two chocolates from the third box?
> 1. Since the order in which the chocolates doesn't matter.
> 2. The first box is equivalent to $C(10, 5)$ ways to select.
> 3. The second box is equivelent to $C(5, 3)$ because after picking 5 chocolates we have 5 left and pick 3. 
> 4. The third box is equivalent to $C(2, 2)$ because we have 2 chocolates left and pick 2
> 5. We multiply all these values together to get our answer
> $$C(10, 5) \cdot C(5, 3) \cdot C(2, 2) = \frac{10!}{5!5!} \frac{5!}{3!2!} \frac{2!}{2!0!} = 252 \cdot 10 \cdot 1 = 2520$$
> ---
> In how many different ways 5-letter arrangements can be formed from the word APPLE?
> 1. Because the P in apple is used twice, we can set up our problem as
> $$C(5, 2) = \frac{5!}{2!} = 60$$

##### Theorem 7.7
The number of r-combinations from a set with n elements when repetition of elements is allowed
$$C(n + r - 1, r) = C(n + r - 1, n - 1)$$
> How many ways are there to create a subset of 3 elements from a set {_a, b, c, d_} with repetitions?
> 1. If we try to find the number of 3-combinations with repetition allowed, for set {a, b, c, d}, we get 20 combinations with repetition, which we can plug into our theorem 7.7 equation
> $$C(4 + 3 - 1, 3) = C(6, 3) = \frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = 20$$

> In how many ways can six people A, B, C, D, E, F seat at a round table?
> 1. Using [[122 Counting and Probability#Unique Circular Permutation|unique circular permutation]] we can find 
> $$P_c(6) = (6-1)! = 5! = 120$$
> ---
> In how many ways can we arrange 9 kids to play musical chairs with 7 chairs?
> $$\frac{P(9,7)}{7} = \frac{181440}{7} = 25920$$
