## LFI
AKA: Local File Inclusion
- A vulnerability that allows users to read and sometimes execute files stored on a server hosting a website. 
- typically through a URL link

```
http://vulnerable-website/file.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd
```
---
## RFI
AKA: Remote File Inclusion
 - Causing a web application to include a remote file in it's file system
```
/**
* Get the filename from a GET input
* Example - http://example.com/?file=index.php
*/
$file = $_GET['file'];

/**
* Unsafely include the file
* Example - index.php
*/
include($file);
```

## XXS 
AKA: Cross Site Scripting
 - Embedding javascript into a webpage through a form that fails to sanitize user input
 - To perform this, you input a new section of javascript into the website, typically through a form so that your input is saved by the website
 ```
 <script>alert("you have been hacked");</script>
 ```
#### Tips:
  - To check if the website was exploited, refer to the webpage's source code through inspect element
  - Sometimes adding `<p><script>...</script></p>` can help you XXS attack to work
 
#### Types of attack:
##### Stored XSS (Persistent): 
When user input is stored on a target server
 > Ex. message forum, log file, database, etc

##### Reflected XSS (Non-Persistent): 
Reflected XSS occurs when user input is immediately returned by a web application in an error message, search result, or any other response that includes some or all of the input provided by the user as part of the request, without that data being made safe to render in the browser, and without permanently storing the user provided data
> Ex. percieved as an error message or other server response

`https://insecure-website.com/search?term=gift` causes the application to echo `<p>You searched for: gift</p>`

##### DOM Based XSS (Non-Persistent): 
An attack exected as a result of the **[[Elements of a Website#DOM Direct Object Modifier|DOM]]** (Direct Object Modifier), causing the page to run unexpectedly. The page itself (the HTTP response that is) does not change, but the client side code contained in the page executes differently due to the malicious modifications that have occurred in the DOM environment
> Ex. Requesting a javascript item from the server
```
http://www.some.site/page.html?default=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
```

## CSRF
AKA: Cross Site Request Forgery
 - Utilizing a user's cookies of a website to perform an unwanted action such as changing the password to one chosen by the attacker. 
 - For example, sending a malicious URL of "reset password" to the victim, where their cookies validate this request and change their password
```
POST http://chat-forum.com/change-password.php?new_email=attackers_password HTTP/1.1

## IDOR (Indirect Object Reference):
Class: Broken Access Control
 - A vulnerability that allows users to access files outside of their permissions through the manipulation of the URL of a website utilizing PHP or direct file reference

PHP
```
https://insecure-website.com/customer_account?customer_number=132355
```
Direct File Reference
```
https://insecure-website.com/customers/12144.txt
```
